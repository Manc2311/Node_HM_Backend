   If you're handing a tool to someone, but you keep giving them a brand new copy every time 
   — even when the old one still works 
   — you're wasting effort and creating clutter.
   useCallback ensures you're reusing the same tool, unless it's actually broken or outdated.


-- useEffect and useLayoutEffect --

 uselayout runs synchronously and useEffect with asynchronous
 1st will render uselayout and then useEffect
 generally use uselayout for scroll or css style rendering quickly
